# FEZ `.pak` archive file description

## Overview

FEZ stores its game assets in four `.pak` files: `Essentials.pak`, `Music.pak`, `Other.pak` and `Updates.pak`. This documentation will attempt to give a rought idea on how to read them.

Notes:

- All of the fields are little-endian unless specified otherwise.
- Strings are prefixed with their length as a seven-bit encoded integer.

## `.pak` archive format

The file starts with a small header of 32-bit integer indicating a number of files in this archive, followed by an array of files.
|Field Type|Description|
|-|-|
|`uint32`|File count defining the size of following array.|
|File Array|Array of variable-sized files, placed one after another.|

Every file in the array is represented as follows:
|Field Type|Description|
|-|-|
|`string`|Path and name of the file without its extension.|
|`uint32`|Size of the file data in bytes.|
|`byte[]`|File data.|

Types of files stored in the archive can vary. Because file extensions are not included, the only indication of a file type is its own header and path/name. In FEZ, there seem to be three file types:

- **XNB** - Microsoft XNA Game Studio 4.0 compiled content containers. Stores textures, sound effects, triles, levels, scripts and other miscellaneous data.
- **Ogg** - digital multimedia container. Stores music.
- **Effect files** - files within the `effects` directory, having no recognisable identifier. Presumably they're the `XFO` files used in XNA Game Studio 4.0.

## `XNB` file format

Header of each XNB file has following structure:

|Field Type|Description|
|-|-|
|`char[3]`|Format identifier. Should be equal to `['X', 'N', 'B']`.|
|`char`|Target platform. Possible values are `w`, `m` and `x` for MS Windows, Windows Phone 7 and Xbox 360 respectively.|
|`byte`|XNB format version. FEZ uses `5` - XNA Game Studio 4.0.|
|`byte`|Flag bits. `0x01` - content is for HiDef profile (used for FEZ assets), `0x40` - data is compressed (LZ4, unused for FEZ), `0x80` - data is compressed (LZX, used for all FEZ assets).|
|`uint32`|Compressed file size, including header.|

If compression flag is set, the rest of the file is compressed and prefixed with `uint32` representing the size of this data after decompression. In case of FEZ, slightly modified LZX algorithm is used for compression. For details, visit [XNB reader code from open source implementation of MonoGame](https://github.com/labnation/MonoGame/blob/d270be3e800a3955886e817cdd06133743a7e043/MonoGame.Framework/Content/ContentManager.cs#L405).

Decompressed/uncompressed file content after header should look like this:
|Field Type|Description|
|-|-|
|`7BitEncodedInt`|Type reader count, defining the number of elements in following array.|
|Type Reader Info Array| An array of type reader information blocks.|
|`7BitEncodedInt`|Shared resource count, defining the number of additional resources in array later on. Always 0 in FEZ.|
|Object| The primary resource of the XNB file.|
|Object Array| Shared resources array. In FEZ, none of the original XNB files contain additional resources.

Eath Type Reader Info Array entry stores information about the `ContentTypeReader<T>` subclass that was used to read the informations within this file.
|Field Type|Description|
|-|-|
|`string`|Type reader name - .NET assembly qualified name of a subclass.|
|`int32`|Version number, usually zero.|

In original XNB files, type reader name includes assembly name specification (which contains assembly identifier, version, culture and public key token). In most cases, they're not required by the game to read the asset file.
However, sometimes it is necessary to include it, especially for readers and types in FezEngine namespace.

Each Object is a reference to a type reader, followed by a raw data.
|Field Type|Description|
|-|-|
|`7BitEncodedInt`|Object type. If non-zero, then `(type - 1)`th entry of Type Reader Info Array is used.|
|`byte[]`|Raw object data. Empty if object type is zero.|
